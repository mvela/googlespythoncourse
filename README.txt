This is my directory that contains files from Google's Python Class found at https://developers.google.com/edu/python/.  I have created and modified many of the files from the source.  In this repository there are files that contain tests I've created to understand how certain functions and methods interact. The rest of the files are my solutions to the problems given as well as the solutions from the source.
